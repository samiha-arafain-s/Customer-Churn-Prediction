**📊 Customer Churn Prediction Using Machine Learning**

**📌 Project Description**

This project is a Customer Churn Prediction System built using Python and Machine Learning. It predicts whether a customer is likely to leave a service based on their historical data. The project includes a web application for training the model and making predictions in real time using a simple and user-friendly interface.


**🎯 Problem Statement**

Customer churn is one of the biggest challenges faced by businesses. Identifying customers who are likely to leave in advance helps companies take preventive actions like offering discounts, better service, and personalized plans.

**✅ Objectives**

>To analyze customer data
>To build a machine learning model for churn prediction
>To provide real-time churn predictions
>To display churn statistics using a dashboard
>To help businesses retain customers
